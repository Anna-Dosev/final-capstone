      <p className="blog-content-text">Northern, coastal Oregon has a reputation for maintaining permanent cloud coverage and a constant veil of mist. 
      While this might be the case for most of the year, the sun is frequently able to break through that canopy during the summer months â€” which is when I arrived.

      I spent the majority of my time in Oregon exploring the coastline and small towns along U.S. Route 101. The numerous state parks and trail systems offer endless
      opportunities to experience not only the rocky beaches and rugged cliffsides, but also the temperate rainforests that border them. The towering Douglas Firs, Ponderosa Pines and Sitka Spruces 
      guard much of the coastline and provide a dramatic backdrop against the sand and sky.

      The activity doesn't stop when the mist returns. Locals are well-equiped for the climate and embrace the outdoors all year round, which is not surprising 
      when you live in a place where you can go surfing and snowboarding in the same day.
