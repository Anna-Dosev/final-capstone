      <p className="blog-content-text">What comes to mind when you think of Florida? It's most likely a combination of Disney, Miami, beaches and crazy news stories.
      While Magic Kingdom and Clearwater Beach are popular for a reason, some of the most beautiful attractions are found quite literally off the beaten path.

      Geological phenomena have formed an expansive freshwater spring system across Florida. Rain water that seeps into the ground dissolves the layers of limestone and dolomite, 
      forming caves and conduits that hold the water. These crystal clear oases stay the same temperature year round, give or take a few degrees. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      If the science goes over your head, so will the swimming holes that the springs provide. The spring heads and offshoots are so clear, you can see more than 40 feet to the bottom, 
      and even swim down if you are properly trained. Because Florida has been under water for most of Earth's history, it is common to find 
      prehistoric shark teeth in the springs and rivers that connect them.

      Generally too cold for alligators and snakes, the springs are a great place to cool off, practice free-diving, paddleboard through the cypress trees and learn about
      the geological factors that go into retrieving much of our drinking water.
