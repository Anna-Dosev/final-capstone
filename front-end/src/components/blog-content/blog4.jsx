      <p className="blog-content-text">While the California coast might get all of the attention, there is another highway that tells a different story.
      <br></br><br></br>
      Highway 395 runs north to south from the Cascade Mountains of northern Washington to the Mojave desert of southern California. My roadtrip buddy, Alex, and I
      drove the stretch of road from Victorville, CA to Tahoe. The bulk of our drive had us nestled between Death Valley and the Eastern Sierras.
      <br></br><br></br>
      The majority of this highway is very remote. So remote that the locals have made friends with extraterrestrials, as indicated by the numerous "Alien Spotting" roadsigns.
      <br></br><br></br>
      Near the turnoff for the town of Bishop, travelers can detour down Whitney Portal Road. This relatively empty stretch of highway will take you directly towards the Sierras, where you can get a glimpse of Mount Whitney,
      which is the tallest mountain in the continental United States. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      Take care, though! The heat on these desert roads can be unforgiving, and gas stations sparse. Fill up the tank regularly, and stock up on water while you have the chance.
