      The ski resorts near Salt Lake, mostly found within the Cottonwood Canyons, offer year-round opportunities to experience nature at its finest. Dozens of trails of varying difficulty line the main roads.
      My personal favorite is the hike up to Cecret Lake from Alta ski base. This three-mile roundtrip trek will take you to an alpine lake along trails where people skiied only a few months before.
      <br></br><br></br>
      In late summer, wildflowers line the trail, providing you an unobscured view of meadow and mountain. Wildlife sightings are quite common in this area, too. Deer, moose and even porcupines call this area home.
